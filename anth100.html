              <b><h3>Course Description</b></h3><text align="left">
              <p>This course will introduce students to the expansive world of anthropology, with an emphasis on the four fields that define the discipline: cultural anthropology/ethnography, archaeology, physical anthropology, and linguistics (to a limited extent). Students will be learn how to use the tools of anthropology to examine some of the key assumptions about what makes us human. How, for instance, does the process of enculturation - the act of teaching a child its cultural over its life course - shape one's personality, actions, and worldview? What aspects of our personalities are formed at birth, and what are learned (also known as the nature vs. nurture debate)? 
              
              <p>Lectures in the course will serve as a supplement and backdrop to the texts assigned, offering contextual information on the methodical, interpretative, and theoretical perspectives presented in the course texts. Thus, to succeed in this course, students must complete the reading and be ready to discuss it in class if called upon. Students will be asked to interrogate and question the text's's arguments by examining the data presented and collected by the text's author. Discussion that is not grounded in scientific reasoning will be curtailed to make room for conversations grounded in the texts and data presented in lectures.
              
              
             <p>We will use a <b>Google Document</b> to comment and keep track of important keywords and concepts during the lecture. Please click <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JCIt6tazEXQ__JBtnA6X0oDrg6WsV8qvpNTJuvZcbzI/edit">here</a> to access the document. You must have a Google account to edit the document. Students are encouraged to add questions to the document as lecture is taking place. Dr. Camp or her teaching assistant will answer questions or clarify concepts during the class or after class. 

               
                            <b><h3>Course Textbooks</b></h3>
              <p>There are <b>four</b> required textbooks that are available for purchase at the University of Idaho's <a href="http://www.vandalstore.com/SiteText.aspx?id=19826">Bookstore</a>. <p><b>Required books include: <p></b>

              <b><h3>Grading</b></h3>
              <p>This course is graded on a cumulative 200 point scale. Below is a breakdown of the points for this course.
    
    <p><b>Quizzes</b> will be held in-class and will cover the content leading up to the day of the quiz. No study guides will be provided for quizzes, which is why it is essential you attend every class, read the course texts, watch the course films, and take extensive notes. 

<p>There will be <b>3 Metacognition</b> assignments due throughout the course. Metacognitions will comprise of a writing prompt asking you to reflect upon some of the current course content. Metacognitions will be handed back with feedback from the teaching assistant or Dr. Camp. Each metacognition is worth 10 points for a total of 30 points throughout the semester. Metacognition assignments should demonstrate a strong command over the course lecture content, course readings, and, when applicable, course films. These are not meant to be "opinion" pieces, but rather sustained, thoughtful, and substantial engagements with the course literature and lecture topics. 

<p>The <b>Final Examination</b> will be held in-class. Please plan your travel accordingly, as there will be no final makeups. A study guide will be provided for the final. A final review session will be held on the last day of the course; please bring your questions to that class rather than emailing them to the course instructor or teaching assistant. The final is comprehensive, meaning that it will cover the entire semester's worth of content. Students are encouraged to form small study groups well in advance of the final examination. Please make sure to bring your own blue book for the examination. Note notes, phones, computers, or other materials will be permitted in the final: please bring your bluebook and a pencil. Final examinations will not be returned to students, but students are welcome to view their graded exam in Dr. Camp's office.

    <h4><b>Note</b>: Portions of these course policies have been taken from the University of Idaho's General Education Syllabus Template, which can be found <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwj0nsqzjNXOAhUM7iYKHcKWC-cQFggcMAA&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.uidaho.edu%2F~%2Fmedia%2FUIdaho-Responsive%2FFiles%2Fclass%2Fdepartments%2Fgeneral-education%2FFaculty%2520Resources%2Fsyllabus-template.ashx&usg=AFQjCNGLRl7QP-ejKpsPLGSRT89MUNv0vA">here</a>.</h4>
           <h3><b>Academic Dishonesty</h3></b>
           <p>Plagiarism of any form will not be tolerated. Plagiarism, in its simplest form, involves
copying someone else’s work and claiming it as your own. I also count plagiarizing your own work from another course and turning it in as if it were new, original work in my
class as plagiarism. To avoid university penalties, always make sure to properly cite your sources, including books, websites, journal articles, unpublished materials, and
discussions with your classmates. Please review the university’s policy on academic dishonesty and citation rules before completing your first written assignment in class.
These guidelines can be found <a href="https://www.uidaho.edu/student-affairs/dean-of-students/student-conduct/academic-integrity">here</a>.
           
            <b><h3>Late Work/Missed Quizzes</b></h3>
            <p>Late work is not accepted unless it is due to an extenuating circumstance, and/or contact has been initiated by the Dean of Student Services' Office.
            
            <b><h3>Policy on Absences for University-related Activities</b></h3>
            <p>The absence policy is enforced by the Vice Provost for Student Affairs and Office of the Dean of Students, and no other written or verbal agreements preempt this policy.  

<p>1. Students are not to be excused from class sessions for any living group-related activities (including, but not limited to, residence hall meetings, fraternity or sorority house meetings, or other living group functions). This includes any function deemed “mandatory” by the living group officers that may carry with it fines or other penalties for non attendance.

<p>2. Only students with a written request signed by a university official will be granted an excused absence for university-sponsored activities, including, but not limited to, travel to sporting events in which the student is an official participant (not spectator) and participation in scheduled, university-sponsored class field trips.

<p>3. Students who seek excused absences from class sessions because of other university-related activities must notify you, the instructor, in advance of their absence to request an excused absence.

<p>4. Students who are granted an excused absence are responsible for completing all work assigned during their absence in the timeframe you, the instructor, establish. 

<p>This policy is designed to help you, the students achieve academic success and to remain a full and productive member of your classroom community.  If you have questions, please contact the Office of the Dean of Students, 208-885-6757, TLC 232.

            <b><h3>Technology Classroom Policy</b></h3>
            <p>The majority of this course involves lectures by Dr. Camp. Phone calls, texting, and use of cellular phones, headsets, MP3 players, and i-Pods during class is prohibited as it detracts from the learning environment. Use of laptops is permitted, but if you are caught using them for non-course related work (e.g. watching YouTube, playing on FaceBook, playing computer games, etc.) you will be asked to stop bringing your laptop to class and a "lit face" will be taken as a course absence. <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2016/05/13/allowing-devices-classroom-hurts-academic-performance-study-finds">Research</a> has demonstrated students learn best using a pen and paper. Unless authorized by DSS or Dr. Camp, <b>video recording of Dr. Camp's lectures for circulation or later use is prohibited</b>.
              
          <b><h3>Instructor Contact</b></h3>
              <p>Dr. Camp is available to meet during the office hours and office location listed at the top of this page. Dr. Camp also holds office hours (by appointment) in the University of Idaho's online campus of Second Life, which can be downloaded by going <a href="http://www.sl.uidaho.edu/">here</a>.

<p>She encourages all students to meet with her one-on-one during the course. If you cannot make the listed office hours, please contact Dr. Camp via the email noted above. <b><i>Because of the size of this particular course, Dr. Camp discourages the regular use of email to ask questions</b></i>. Please ask questions during the class, or in-person during office hours. Please note that Dr. Camp does not check email over the weekends. When emailing Dr. Camp, you can address her as "Professor Camp" or "Dr. Camp." 
              
              <b><h3>Course Etiquette</b></h3>
              <p>Beyond the obvious (no eating, sleeping, talking, texting, phone-calling, Skyping, etc., etc., etc.), you are expected to remain civil and polite in my classroom. Our course will delve deeply into controversial topics such as sexuality, religion, infanticide, and warfare, and you will be expected to be courteous and thoughtful when discussing these topics in course. Attacking or verbly harrassing your fellow students is not permitted. The classroom is certainly open for constructive, text- and course content-based debate, but it is not a place for verbale attacks on an individual or groups of individuals. University classes stick to data and facts, not opinions. <p>Please review the University of Idaho's <a href="https://www.uidaho.edu/student-affairs/dean-of-students/student-conduct/student-code-of-conduct">Student Code of Conduct</a> for more information on course and campus behavior.
              <p>
              
              <b><h3>Disability Support Services Reasonable Accommodations</h3></b>
              <p>Reasonable accommodations are available for students who have documented temporary or permanent disabilities. All accommodations must be approved through Disability Support Services, located in the Idaho Commons Building, Room 306, in order to notify your instructor(s) as soon as possible regarding accommodation(s) needed for the course. Contact DSS at 208-885‐6307, email <a mailto:"dss@uidaho.edu">dss@uidaho.edu</a> or go to <a href="www.uidaho.edu/dss">DSS</a>.
              
                  <b><h3>Study Skills & Resources</h3></b>
              <p>You should spend, on average, at least 3 hours of study time (textbook reading, reviewing class notes, etc.) for each hour you spend in class. There is additional time devoted to researching and writing papers, and to developing projects. Plan accordingly. If you need help with note-taking, strategies for studying, writing, time-management, or tutoring assistance, please do not hesitate to contact your teaching assistant or Dr. Camp.
              
              <b><h3>Library Resources & Support</h3></b>
              <p>The UI Library has people and resources to help you succeed in research for this course. The library <a href="http://www.lib.uidaho.edu">website</a> has many databases that will help you find relevant and reliable books, articles, images, and more, many available online.

                  <b><h3>Writing Support</h3></b>
              <p><a href="http://www.uidaho.edu/class/english/WritingCenter">The Writing Center</a> is a collaborative learning program dedicated to providing one-on-one assistance to student writers. The Writing Center also provides a library of handbooks and style manuals, three student computers, a collection of handouts about writing, and a comfortable place to sit, read, and write. Please utilize it for Metacognition assignments, as they will be graded on style, grammar, form, and content.
              
                  <b><h3>Firearms Policy</h3></b>
                 <p> The University of Idaho bans firearms from its property with only limited exceptions. One exception applies to persons who hold a valid Idaho enhanced concealed carry license, provided those firearms remain concealed at all times. If an enhanced concealed carry license holder’s firearm is displayed, other than in necessary self-defense, it is a violation of University policy. Please contact local law enforcement (call 911) to report firearms on University property.

              <b><h3>University Classroom Learning Civility Clause</h3></b>
            <p>  In any environment in which people gather to learn, it is essential that all members feel as free and safe as possible in their participation. To this end, it is expected that everyone in this course will be treated with mutual respect and civility, with an understanding that all of us (students, instructors, professors, guests, and teaching assistants) will be respectful and civil to one another in discussion, in action, in teaching, and in learning.  
              <p>
<p>Should you feel our classroom interactions do not reflect an environment of civility and respect, you are encouraged to meet with your instructor during office hours to discuss your concern. Additional resources for expression of concern or requesting support include the Dean of Students office and staff (5-6757), the UI Counseling & Testing Center’s confidential services (5-6716), or the UI Office of Human Rights, Access, & Inclusion (5-4285).
